            <p> Be it overflowing bins , stray dog menace or breeding mosquitoes in your locality , you have to deal with them till
            the authority takes an action. Only when people become ill or are attacked by dogs, and the issue becomes a headline in the newspaper some action 
            is taken.<br/>But isn't it too late. We keep on posting on social media about the negligence of our authorities , mocking them and gaining sympathies .
            Now its time to present your problems at a platform where we aim to bring together the world to share their problems and call for proper action.
            Becaues its rightly said <br/>
            'united we stand divided we fall'.

            We might change ourselves and follow the rules.<br/> But one person cannot change the entire country. Post pictures of people breaking the rules. Not only traffic rules 
            but other rules as well which are considered to result in punishment if broken. If you see someone littering the roads, peeing in public,damaging property,indulging in theft etc. Post pictures , details etc so that action can be taken against them.
